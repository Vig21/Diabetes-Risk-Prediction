# Diabetes-Risk-Prediction
A machine learning model developed to predict an individual's risk of diabetes using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. Leveraging health and lifestyle features from BRFSS survey data, this project implements predictive analytics to proactively identify at-risk individuals, enabling targeted preventative care.
Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict the risk of diabetes in individuals based on health and lifestyle information gathered from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The project emphasizes interpretability and actionable insights, facilitating proactive healthcare management.

# Features

Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive cleaning and handling of missing data from BRFSS surveys.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and insights to understand underlying patterns.

Model Training and Evaluation: Comparison of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.

Explainability: Implementation of SHAP values to interpret model predictions.

Deployment Ready: Modular codebase ready for integration with healthcare applications.

# Dataset

Source: CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)

Description: National survey data on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and preventive services.
