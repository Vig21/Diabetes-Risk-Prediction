# Diabetes-Risk-Prediction
A machine learning model developed to predict an individual's risk of diabetes using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. Leveraging health and lifestyle features from BRFSS survey data, this project implements predictive analytics to proactively identify at-risk individuals, enabling targeted preventative care.
